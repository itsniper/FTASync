/*!
A Parse Framework User Object that is a local representation of a user persisted to the Parse cloud. This class
 is a subclass of a PFObject, and retains the same functionality of a PFObject, but also extends it with various
 user specific methods, like authentication, signing up, and validation uniqueness.
 
 Many APIs responsible for linking a PFUser with Facebook or Twitter have been deprecated in favor of dedicated
 utilities for each social network. See PFFacebookUtils and PFTwitterUtils for more information.
