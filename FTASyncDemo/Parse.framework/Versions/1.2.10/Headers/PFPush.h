/*!
 A class which defines a push notification that can be sent from
 a client device.

 The preferred way of modifying or retrieving channel subscriptions is to use
 the PFInstallation class, instead of the class methods in PFPush.

 This class is currently for iOS only. Parse does not handle Push Notifications
 to Parse applications running on OS X. Push Notifications can be sent from OS X
 applications via Cloud Code or the REST API to push-enabled devices (e.g. iOS
 or Android).
